.SH NAME
nicrec \- NIC Recorder. Uses perl
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B nicrec
[-hvV] [-i int[,int...]] | [interval [count]]

.SH DESCRIPTION
nicrec records per per-NIC statistics:
number of KBytes received/sec, number of packets received/sec, 
number of KBytes transmitted/sec, number of packets transmitted/sec 
and many other metrics. 

.PP
The recorder uses Sys::Statistics::Linux to fetch all metrics. 
The raw data is already prepared and formatted for SDR analysis process. 
The recorder runs continuously.

.SH OS
Linux 2.6+

.SH OPTIONS

.SS
\-h
print help information
.SS
\-v

.SS
\-V
print revision information
.SS
interval
interval in seconds between each sample
.SS
count
number of samples

.SH EXAMPLES
.SS nicrec 5
monitor all found NICs every 5 seconds 

.SS nicrec -i eth0 5 10
monitor eth0 interface only, 10 times sampled every 5 seconds

.SS nicrec -i wlan0,eth1,eth1:2 1.5
monitor wlan0, eth1 and eth1:2 interfaces every 1.5 seconds

.SH NOTES
This recorder supports interval values lower than second !  Running the
recorder  with  values  lower than second for long periods of time will
add an overhead in terms of CPU utilisation.  The  lower  the  interval
value  the higher the CPU utilisation. We do not recommend using values
lower than second for long historical recordings !

.PP
nicrec records 18 Linux OS metrics on x64 and x86 platforms !

.SH DOCUMENTATION
See SDR documentation for more details.
.SH EXIT

or manually stopped.

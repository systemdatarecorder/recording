<P>
This is a program to rotate log files. It can rotate any file listed in its
configuration file. The file does not necessarily need to be log file. This
program imitates the <CODE>logrotate</CODE> and <CODE>newsyslog</CODE> programs found on Linux and FreeBSD respectively. I originally wrote this
to make life easier in Solaris.

<P>
Specify the location of the configuration file. Multiple configuration
files can be separated by commas with no spaces.

<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item__d">-d</A></STRONG><DD>
<P>
Turn on debug output. This is verbose output that shows most of what
<CODE>rotatelog</CODE> does.

Print the help information.

<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item__t">-t</A></STRONG><DD>
<P>
Turn on the test flag. This causes <CODE>rotatelog</CODE> to run as if all files need rotation, but disallows the actual rotation.
This is most useful in combination with the <STRONG>-d</STRONG> flag.

This program will exit if it cannot open its configuration
<CODE>file(s)</CODE> and if any of the system calls fail. This program will
also exit if the there are any syntax errors in the actions section. Any
other configuration file errors are ignored and a warning is issued. All
error messages are printed to <CODE>STDERR</CODE>. This program is meant to be run as a cron job so error messages such as
these will be mailed to the owner of the cron job. Many times <CODE>rotatelog</CODE> is run in the <CODE>root</CODE> crontab.

<P>
<HR>
<H1><A NAME="FILES">FILES</A></H1>
<P>
The <CODE>rotatelog</CODE> program depends upon its configuration file for information concerning what
files to rotate and when to rotate them. The <CODE>rotatelog.conf</CODE> file is located in the <CODE>/usr/local/etc</CODE> directory by default. This location is set in the configuration section of
the source code along with the paths to certain system utility functions.
It is possible to specify a new configuration file via the <CODE>-c</CODE> command line option, and it is also possible to specify multiple
configuration files in this manner as well using the form <CODE>-c file1,file2,file3</CODE>. Note that configuration files that appear later in a multiple
configuration specification can override settings in previous configuration
files. When installing this program it will be necessary to check this
section of the source code. Along with specifying the the files to rotate
there is also the ability to specify ownership and mode of the files after
rotation, the number of rotated files to keep, the compression used or not
used on the rotated files, and an auxiliary action in the form of a shell
command to take place when certain files are rotated. The <CODE>rotatelog</CODE> program is normally run as <CODE>root</CODE>. It is important that the config file is only writable by <CODE>root</CODE> due to the ability to execute shell commands!

<P>
There are three sections in the configuration file. They can appear in any
order. Each section is identified by a keyword. Configuration information
follows the keyword and extends until the next keyword. Keywords can come
in any order and repeat, but it would be best to follow a simple format
such as:

<P>
<PRE> FILES:
</PRE>
<P>
<PRE> # File  Trigger  Owner:Group  Mode  Compress  Archive_Limit
 # =========================================================
</PRE>
<P>
<PRE> /var/log/wtmp      1M   root:wheel  664  none  4
 /var/log/wtmpx     4M   root:wheel  644  none  4
 /var/log/messages  74K  root:wheel  664  Z     5
 /var/log/maillog   60K  root:wheel  664  gz    7
</PRE>
<P>
<PRE> ACTIONS:
</PRE>
<P>
<PRE> # Shell Command :file1,file2,file3 ... fileN
 # ==========================================
</PRE>
<P>
<PRE> rotate1                             : /var/log/wtmp,/var/log/wtmpx
 kill -HUP `cat /var/run/syslog.pid` : /var/log/messages,/var/log/maillog
</PRE>
<P>
<PRE> NOTIFY:
</PRE>
<P>
<PRE> # Person to email rotation notification
 # =====================================
</PRE>
<P>
<PRE> root@localhost
</PRE>
<P>
Comment lines must contain a pound sign at the start of the line. These
comment lines are ignored along with blank lines and lines containing only
whitespace. In general there can be no leading whitespace on configuration
lines while there can be any amount of whitespace between elements.

<P>
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="Files">Files</A></H2>
<P>
The files section specifies which files are to be rotated, when they are to
be rotated, what their ownership and modes are to be post rotation, how
many rotated copies are to be retained, and the compression used on the
files once rotated. The beginning of the files section is noted by the
occurrence of the <CODE>FILES:</CODE> keyword.

<P>
This information must adhere to the following syntax:

<P>
<PRE> File  Trigger  Owner:Group  Mode  Compress  Archive_Limit
</PRE>
<P>
For example:

<P>
<PRE> /var/log/wtmp      1M   root:wheel  664  none  4
 /var/log/wtmpx     4M   root:wheel  644  none  4
 /var/log/messages  74K  root:wheel  664  Z     5
 /var/log/maillog   60K  root:wheel  664  gz    7
</PRE>
<P>
The fields above can be separated by any amount of whitespace. The first
field is the full path to the file that requires rotation. The second field
is the <CODE>trigger</CODE>. The <CODE>trigger</CODE> specifies when rotation is to occur. The <CODE>trigger</CODE> is the maximum size of a file in bytes, kilobytes, or megabytes. Bytes can
be specified with B or b, kilobytes with K or k, or megabytes can be
specified with M or m. If a file listed is found to be larger than the <CODE>trigger</CODE> it is rotated. The
<CODE>owner:group</CODE> field specifies who is to own the file once it is rotated. The <CODE>mode</CODE> is the file permission mode in octal notation of the rotated file as
specified in the <CODE>chmod(1)</CODE> manual page. The mode does not
include the optional first digit of the four digit <CODE>chmod(1)</CODE>
octal mode. The mode is only the simple three digit format shown above. The <CODE>compression</CODE> field specifies the type of compression to use on the rotated file. A file
can be compressed with <CODE>gzip</CODE> (gz), <CODE>compress</CODE>
(Z), or not at all (none). The <CODE>archive limit</CODE> field specifies how many copies of a rotated file to keep. This number is
the highest count in the rotation scheme. The rotation count starts at 0 so
this is actually one higher then the total number of files kept. If the
<CODE>archive limit</CODE> were set to 4 for the file <CODE>/var/log/wtmp</CODE> the maximum number of archived <CODE>wtmp</CODE> files would be 5. The files would appear in the <CODE>/var/log/</CODE> directory as:

<P>
<PRE> wtmp    &lt;-- the current wtmp file.
 wtmp.0  &lt;-- the first archive of wtmp.
 .
 .
 .
 wtmp.4  &lt;-- the last archive of wtmp.
</PRE>
<P>
If the last file of an archive exists, wtmp.4 in the above example, it is
removed during the rotation and the previous archive file wtmp.3 is renamed
accordingly. All other files are rotated in the same manner until the
current file is reached and rotated.

<P>
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="Actions">Actions</A></H2>
<P>
The actions section specifies if any actions are to occur for any of the
rotated files. The actions section is denoted by the <CODE>ACTIONS:</CODE>
keyword. Sometimes a process must be notified that it must close its file
descriptors and open new ones due to something like a file rotation. Many
processes will handle this action when the receive a
<CODE>SIGHUP</CODE> signal. Most of the time a <CODE>kill -HUP</CODE> on the process will accomplish this. One example is <CODE>syslogd</CODE>. We can see that <CODE>syslogd</CODE>
has certain files open all of the time by using <CODE>lsof</CODE> to inquire about the status of one of its log files:

<P>
<PRE> [rowland@darkstar rowland]$ sudo lsof /var/log/messages
 COMMAND PID USER   FD   TYPE   DEVICE SIZE/OFF NODE NAME
 syslogd  99 root    8w  VREG 4,131076     3119  232 /var/log/messages
</PRE>
<P>
It is not enough to just move the current file into the archive and touch a
new one for writing. The <CODE>syslogd</CODE> process must be told that a new file exists and that it is to close the
current file descriptor and open a new one on the same file name (not to
keep writing to the file pointed to by the current file descriptor). This
is what the actions section does. The actions section has the following
syntax:

<P>
<PRE> Shell Command : file1, file2, file3, ... fileN
 - or -
 Shell Command : rotate1, rotate2, ... rotateN
</PRE>
<P>
For example:

<P>
<PRE> rotate1                             : /var/log/wtwp, /var/log/wtmpx
 - or -
 kill -HUP `cat /var/run/syslog.pid` : rotate1
 - or -
 kill -HUP `cat /var/run/syslog.pid` : /var/log/messages,/var/log/maillog
</PRE>
<P>
You are free to add whitespace around the <CODE>:</CODE> and <CODE>,</CODE> characters. This extra whitespace will be ignored. When the <CODE>/var/log/messages</CODE>
file is to be rotated it is first moved to a new name, but not compressed.
The <CODE>syslogd</CODE> program will still be writing to this file even though the name has changed
because its file descriptor points to this location on the filesystem and
the file descriptor is still open at this point. A new file is touched and
its permissions and ownership are set to the values specified in the files
section. Then the <CODE>SIGHUP</CODE>
signal is the sent to <CODE>syslogd</CODE>, and it closes the rotated file and opens the new file that replaces it.
After this is done it is safe to compress the old file if compression was
specified in the files section.

<P>
There is also a special action called <CODE>rotate</CODE> which allows you to bind multiple files together for rotation. All of the
files must be present in the files section so that <CODE>rotatelog</CODE> knows how to rotate them. When one file is rotated then the other files
bound with it are rotated immediately. The format of <CODE>rotate</CODE> is:

<P>
<PRE> rotateN : file1, file2, ... fileN
</PRE>
<P>
The <CODE>rotate</CODE> command must be followed by an integer. This allows for more than one
binding but only for different groups of files. You may not leave the
integer off. The <CODE>wtmp</CODE> file is a good candidate for this type of rotation. When the <CODE>wtmp</CODE> file is rotated it is a good idea to also rotate the <CODE>wtmpx</CODE> file. A binding of:

<P>
<PRE> rotate1 : /var/adm/wtmp, /var/adm/wtmpx
</PRE>
<P>
will rotate both files whenever one of them needs rotation. When binding
files for rotation in this manner, there is only one way to associate
another action (a normal shell command) to the rotation of the bound files.
Using the <CODE>rotate</CODE> action indicates that all files are to be rotated at the same time. If an
action is also to occur, we must be certain that all of the files have
begun rotation before executing that action. An action on the group of
bound files in the <CODE>rotate</CODE> group is specified by using that <CODE>rotate</CODE> action as the bound file for the normal shell command action. The <CODE>syslogd</CODE> example is perfect for this. In the <CODE>syslogd</CODE> case one would probably want to send <CODE>syslogd</CODE>
a <CODE>SIGHUP</CODE> signal once all <CODE>syslogd</CODE> files have been rotated. This is how that is accomplished:

<P>
<PRE> rotate2                             : /var/log/messages,/var/log/maillog
 kill -HUP `cat /var/run/syslog.pid` : rotate2
</PRE>
<P>
This ensures the following steps occur during file rotation:

<P>
<PRE> 1.  Begin rotation on a file.
          - Figure out the archive count of the current file.
          - Rotate old logs up one count, removing the last if necessary.
          - Rotate the current file up one count.
          - Touch a new version of the file.
</PRE>
<P>
<PRE> 2.  Perform any actions on the file.
          - Check rotateN bound files.
                 [if file is in a rotateN group]
                 - Begin any file rotation on the other files in the
                   rotateN bound group.  All other files are put
                   through step #1 at this point.
                 - Perform any normal shell command action associated
                   with this group of rotateN bound files.
                 - Finish rotation of all other files bound in the
                   rotateN group.  This is step #3.
                 - Return.  This causes the original file that triggered
                   this recursion to finish its rotation.
          - Check normal shell command actions.
                 [in this case the file was not in a rotateN group]
                 - Perform the shell command action.
                 - Return.  This moves the file into step #3.
</PRE>
<P>
<PRE> 3.  Finish rotating a file.
          - Compress the previous log file if the file has been specified
            for compression in the files section.
          - Add the file to the list of files which have been rotated.
</PRE>
<P>
This process ensures that any files bound together are in the beginning of
file rotation before any shell commands are executed as a result of this
rotation. Once the shell command action occurs, if there is one, all of the
files finish their rotation. Due to this flexibility in file rotation
actions, the following rules apply to the actions section:

<P>
<PRE> 1.  A file may appear in only one rotateN group.
</PRE>
<P>
<PRE> 2.  A file may appear in only one normal shell command group.
</PRE>
<P>
<PRE> 3.  A file may not appear in both a rotateN group and a normal shell
     command action.
</PRE>
<P>
<PRE> 4.  A normal shell command may be bound explicitly to a file that is
     not in a rotateN group.
</PRE>
<P>
<PRE> 5.  A normal shell command cannot be bound to a file in a rotateN
     group explicitly.  To bind a shell command to files in a rotateN
     group one must implicitly bind the command to the rotateN action.
</PRE>
<P>
If there are no actions to perform when any of the files are rotated this
section may be omitted from the configuration file. If you rotate log files
written to by <CODE>syslogd</CODE> then you will most certainly require one of the examples above with the
appropriate path to your
<CODE>syslogd.pid</CODE> file. If you leave out this step and rotate <CODE>syslogd</CODE>
files, <CODE>syslogd</CODE> will most certainly NOT be your friend. If you choose to bind <CODE>syslogd</CODE> files together in a rotateN group, all of the files will be rotated when
one file is rotated. If you want to define the action for each file, only
when that file is rotated, do not use the rotateN form of the action. It
all depends on what you wish to do.

<P>
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="Notify">Notify</A></H2>
<P>
The notify section specifies who is to receive notification in the event
that any files are rotated. The notify section is started with the
<CODE>NOTIFY:</CODE> keyword. The notification is sent out via email to the full email address
specified in this section. This is the simplest section. The email address
is simply listed as in the following example:

<P>
<PRE> # Person to receive email rotation notification
 # =============================================
</PRE>
<P>
<PRE> root@localhost
</PRE>
<P>
If there is to be no notification this section may be omitted or a value of
``none'' may be used. There can only be one email address in this section.

<P>
<HR>
<H1><A NAME="RESTRICTIONS">RESTRICTIONS</A></H1>
<P>
There can be no leading whitespace on config file lines. Someday I may fix
that. The files must be specified with their full paths in all sections.
This is true in the actions section where you can list an action for
multiple files. If there are any syntax errors in the configuration file
those lines will be ignored and a warning will be printed to <CODE>STDERR</CODE>. If this program is run as a cron job this will result in an email message
to the owner of the cron job. In most cases this will be <CODE>root</CODE>.

<P>
Revision 1.5 2001/05/23 15:04:47 rowland Fixed a bug where extra whitespace

<P>
Revision 1.4 2001/05/19 21:23:32 rowland Updated the following in logrotate
1.3:

<P>
<PRE>        * Added the -c and -h command line options.
        * Added the B and b trigger size specification.
        * Changed the release Makefile to create installation directories if
          they do not already exist.
</PRE>
<P>
Revision 1.3 2001/04/22 23:01:36 rowland Updated perldoc and config file to
better reflect reality in rotating syslogd files. You wouldn not normally
put these files in a rotateN group and then define an action for that group
because this would cause all of the files to be rotated when just one of
them is rotated. You could do this if you wanted, but it makes a perfect
example. Better examples will follow later, but the examples here should
better reflect reality.

<P>
Revision 1.2 2001/04/22 22:45:25 rowland Added more actions section error
checking and cleaned up the default settings.

<P>
Revision 1.1.1.1 2001/04/22 21:58:26 rowland The rotatelog program was
designed to rotate files and perform actions on those files once rotated if
desired. This program began its life as logrotate. I changed the name so it
would not be confused with the GNU logrotate program. This version includes
improved code for handling rotateN bound files and actions on those bound
files (in other words it now works properly).
